# SimpleUI

This project aims to provide a simple object oriented ui-system for small embedded screens.

## Structure

In object oriented fashion the framework has a hirachical structure and builds each component on one or more base classes.

dimensions
└── uiElement
    ├── uiGroup
    ├── uiPage
    └── StaticLabel
        └── uiInteractiveText
uiInteractive
└── uiInteractiveText

## UI-Tree

This is a sample structure for a posible ui-tree. It starts at the uiRoot object. The uiRoot receives all inputs and starts the drawing function. The base class uiElement can contain a pointer to a child and to a parent. uiGroup inherits from uiElement but does things differently. uiGroup does not contain a single child but multiple and can manage them. Because uiRoot doesnt inherit from uiElement there is a need of a glue object between uiRoot and uiElement. This is uiPage.

When building an ui we only add child objects. This means each object only knows its child(s). The parent pointer is learned during runtime.

uiRoot
├── uiPage
│   └── uiGroup
│       ├── uiElement
│       ├── uiElement
│       ├── uiGroup
│       │   ├── uiElement
│       │   └── ...
│       └── ...
├── uiPage
│   └── uiElement
└── uiPage
    └── ...

## Wording

- Focus: In the ui-tree only one object can have the focus. Focus means that this element processes user inputs.
- Selection: Multiple uiElements can be selected. A selection is usualy shown by inverting or flashing. Selections are made by the parent object and shown by the child. A child can deny or forward selections based on selectable and the focus mode.

## Basics

### UIalign

### UIEventType

### tabPos

### dimensions

Dimensions is a baseclass and provides positional and size information.

### Viewport

Holds information about the display device and posible restrictions. Viewport is part of the frameInfo

### frameInfo

Holds global information about the current frame. It is used during the drawing cycle.

### FocusState

This is internal and used to determ the focus position in the ui-hirachy.

### FocusMode

FocusMode can be set for each uiElement and controls how the element reacts to focus changes. The folowing modes are available:

- target: The element can receive focus and is selectable.
- passthrough: The element can receive focus but will passthrough to its child. If there is no child the focus will bounce and may lead to a crash.
- passive: The element can not receive focus. If it does the focus wil bounce.
